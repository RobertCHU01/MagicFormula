## What is Magic Formula
### Related Concepts
To understand the idea of magic formula, we first need to learn two financial concepts--Capital Return & Stock Yield.

#### Capital Return/Return on Assets(ROA)
ROA = Net Income/Total Assets


ROA measures a company's ability to converts input(investment) into output(income). Companies with higher ROA can get more income from a fixed amount of assets. A company with high ROA is a good company, because it has fast development. However, ROA is not enough for us to determine whether we want to buy a stock, because a company has good future development does not mean that we can earn money on its stock. To earn money on its stock, we need to look at another factor--Stock Yield.

#### Stock Yield/Dividend Yield
Dividend Yield = Annual Dividends Per Share/Price per share


Divendend Yield measures your income from stock from the money you invest. You can invest less money in a company with high Divendend Yield to get the same income as invest more money in a company with low Divendend Yield, so we "pay" less for same income. In summary, a stock with high Dividend Yield is a "low-price" stock.

### Magic Formula
Magic formula looks for a stock with both high ROA and high Dividend Yield. 


In this way, we are buy a "good quality" stock with "low price". However, the real implementation of Magic formula is more complex, because we usually want a basket of stocks to reduce risks. This involves selecting top 30 stocks, selecting from large/small companies, renewing our formula every month... One thing to keep in mind is magic formula only shows its magic in the long term and investment is never a short-time gambling, so if your magic formula does not perform well, stick to it!!! and See what happens in 5-6 years.
